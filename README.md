This repository contains scripts used to solve programming challenges available over at reddit's /r/dailyprogrammer.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges) is an almost complete list of the available challenges.

All solutions so far are in Javascript.

Stuff I had to learn in specific challenges:

easy \#6 - [math.js package](http://mathjs.org/)

easy \#10 - [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
